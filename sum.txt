Background (Why):

Identify potential exceptions related to merchant refunds for accounts with zero balance.
Intent (What):

Find cases where a customer's account balance was zero around the time a merchant refund was processed.
Method (How):

Stage data (temporary tables): Identify recently confirmed frozen accounts and their associated refunds within the past year.
Analyze and correlate: Search for instances where the account balance was zero around the refund date.
Filter and load: Include cases where the zero balance occurred within a specific window relative to the frozen account date, and load results into a permanent table.


Background (Why):

Identify recently frozen accounts (within the last 10 days) that have had debit transactions within the past week.
Focus on specific transaction categories (excluding cash advances, balance transfers, and some types of insurance).
Intent (What):

Find accounts that were recently frozen and then had debit transactions shortly after.
This might indicate suspicious activity on the account.
Method (How):

Identify recently frozen accounts (FRD_STAT_CD) using account status history.
Find transactions for those accounts within a specific date range (past week) using transaction history.
Filter transactions based on category and type (debit transactions excluding specific categories).
Join the data with account balance history to ensure the balance was positive at the transaction time.
Combine and format the results into a single table
