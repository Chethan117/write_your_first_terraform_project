Dear Tram,

I hope this email finds you well.

Attached are the metrics for March, along with a PowerPoint deck outlining our threshold calculation process. Your input on plotting the threshold visually is essential to enhance clarity and efficiency. If you have specific preferences or requirements regarding the visuals, please share them with us. We're available to discuss further at your earliest convenience.

Looking forward to your valuable input
