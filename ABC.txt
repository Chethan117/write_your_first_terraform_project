My weekend was both relaxing and special as I celebrated my birthday. I spent it unwinding, received calls from friends and family, and managed to watch some cricket â€“ which was delightful. On Saturday night, a friend from Derby paid an unexpected visit, so we decided to explore some local bars. It was my last birthday as a bachelor, so we made the most of it. Overall, it was quite a memorable weekend.
